Haskell projects

I used these projects to learn the basics of functional programming in Haskell
I used ghc/ghci to compile/interpret my Haskell projects

File: 00_functions.hs
  - file used for writing and testing shorted "independant" haskell functions

File: 01_public_transport.hs
  - A small program to try more complex functions
  - Acording to the databease of tickets and trips you should be able to filter prices and trips

File: 02_turing_machine.hs
  - A small project to program a turing complete maching in Haskell
  - When given two tapes, one with data, the odther one with commands, this machine is able to make calculations
    with data from the data-tape using commands from the command-tape

File: 03_math_expressions.hs
  - A project to evaluate simple math expressions
  - This program should evaluate simple math expressions with variables and simple operations using resursion
